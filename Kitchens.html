            <p>This Kitchen is another variation of the Shaker Style kitchen that we offer, however, this time in a pale-green colour with solid oak worktops. We find this Kitchen is particularly popular in newer apartments and homes as it's quite contemporary in design and really brightens up the room.</p>

            <img alt="Blue contemporary Apt Photo" src="Images/KitchenBlueComtempary3.jpg">
            <p>This Kitchen design is most popular for apartments as it is smaller in size and is designed with smaller apartments in mind. This surface door shaker style kitchen includes solid oak worktops and really adds a sense of luxury to any apartment.</p>
